## Defining ‚Äúinstitutional <br>science communication‚Äù

### How do we define it?

* Based on what we are _not_ doing

* Everything under the sun

* ‚ÄúAll‚Äù audiences ‚â° vague, undefined audience

* Internal audiences vs external audiences; themselves varied

* ‚Ä¶

Pause to ask question.

### What kinds of institutions?

* Research laboratories

* European projects

* Nature charities

* Universities

* Science centres

* ‚Ä¶

### Scope of science communication

* Share latest research

* Celebrate milestones

## Social media for institutions

### Caveats

* I have never used TikTok!

* I miss the old Twitter

* I have strong opinions on social media and ethics

  * (slight understatement)

### Expectations

* Broadcast only

* No reacting / re-sharing unofficial accounts

* Use platforms with existing audiences

* Collaborate with partner institutions only

### Opportunities

* New platforms for occasional activities

  * [Hangouts on Google+](https://hangouts.web.cern.ch/hangouts/archive.html)

  * [Reddit AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/37ldev/we_just_broke_a_world_record_at_the_large_hadron/)

* Showcasing diversity

* [Independent popsci communicators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txq6ChEMqio)

### Scientists and social media

* What motivates them?

* What gets in their way?

  * Language? Culture?

* Opportunities for development

  * Who prefers which platform?

  * Are we excluding people based on assumptions?

## My lessons

### How to embrace your role

* Trust yourself; in most situations, you might be the expert

* Earn trust; this happens gradually

* Stand up for your principles, but gently if possible
